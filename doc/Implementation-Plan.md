# MCP-SQLite Implementation Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This project plan outlines the development of mcp-sqlite, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides full-featured access to SQLite databases. The server will enable AI assistants and other MCP clients to safely query, analyze, and manage SQLite databases through a standardized interface.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Develop a production-ready MCP server for SQLite database interactions
- Provide comprehensive CRUD operations with proper safety controls
- Implement schema introspection and query validation
- Ensure secure, sandboxed database operations
- Create thorough documentation and examples

### Success Criteria
- Full compliance with MCP specification
- Support for all major SQLite operations
- Query execution under 100ms for typical operations
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Clear documentation with practical examples

- Query result formatting and type conversion

**3. Security & Safety Module**
- Query validation and sanitization
- Read-only mode support
- Query timeout enforcement
- Resource usage limits
- Access control for sensitive operations

**4. Tool Definitions**
- `query`: Execute SELECT statements
- `execute`: Run INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- `schema`: Retrieve database schema information
- `tables`: List all tables and views
- `analyze`: Run EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
- `transaction`: Manage transactions
- `backup`: Create database backups

### Technology Stack

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: SQLite file locking issues in concurrent environments
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper connection pooling and WAL mode
- **Contingency**: Add queuing system for write operations

**Risk**: Performance degradation with large result sets
- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and streaming responses
- **Contingency**: Add result size limits and warnings

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in query execution
- **Mitigation**: Use parameterized queries, implement allowlists
- **Contingency**: Add sandboxing and restricted execution modes

### Project Risks

**Risk**: Scope creep with additional database features
- **Mitigation**: Clearly define MVP features, maintain backlog
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline or defer to version 2

**Risk**: MCP specification changes during development
- **Mitigation**: Regular sync with MCP team, version pinning
- **Contingency**: Adapter pattern for specification changes
